# spring-boot-undertow

Community-maintained Undertow starter for Spring Boot 4.x.

This project is a fork of the Undertow embedded server support originally developed as part of [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot). The original source code served as the foundation and has been independently developed since.

## Background

Undertow support was [removed from Spring Boot 4.0](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/46917) because no Servlet 6.1-compatible Undertow release existed at the time. The Spring Boot team has [explicitly declined](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/50381) re-adding it upstream, recommending a community-maintained third-party starter instead.

This project fills that gap using [Undertow EE](https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow-ee) 2.0.0.Final (which implements Jakarta Servlet 6.1) and the modularised Undertow support from Spring Boot 4.0.0-M1 as the starting point.

## Project Structure

```
spring-boot-undertow/
├── pom.xml                                       <- parent POM
├── module/
│   └── spring-boot-undertow/                     <- core Undertow integration
│       └── pom.xml
└── starter/
    └── spring-boot-starter-undertow/             <- Undertow starter
        └── pom.xml
```

## Usage

Add the starter to your Spring Boot 4 project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.redhat.integration</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-undertow</artifactId>
    <version>${undertow-starter.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Make sure to exclude the default Tomcat starter if you are using `spring-boot-starter-web`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

### WebFlux (Reactive) Support

This starter also works with `spring-boot-starter-webflux`. Reactive HTTP handling goes through the Servlet bridge (`ServletHttpHandlerAdapter`), the same approach Spring Boot uses for Jetty reactive support.

### Micrometer Metrics

When `spring-boot-starter-actuator` and `micrometer-core` are on the classpath, Undertow-specific metrics are automatically registered:

- `undertow.threads.worker.*` - XNIO worker thread pool metrics (core, max, current, busy, queue size)
- `undertow.threads.io` - IO thread count
- `undertow.sessions.*` - Session metrics (active, created, expired)

## Building

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Tests

This project uses the Spring Boot Web Server TCK (`spring-boot-web-server` test-fixtures) to validate compatibility. The test-fixtures are not published to Maven Central, so you need to build Spring Boot locally first:

```bash
# 1. Clone and build Spring Boot to install test-fixtures to your local Maven repo
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot.git
cd spring-boot
git checkout v4.0.6
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

# 2. Run the TCK tests with the 'tck' profile
cd /path/to/spring-boot-undertow
mvn test -pl module/spring-boot-undertow -Ptck
```

**Test results:** 222 tests, 214 pass, 6 skipped, 8 known incompatibilities:

- **5 log-message pattern tests** (inherited from TCK): The abstract base class uses a `(Jetty|Tomcat)` regex that cannot be modified. Equivalent Undertow-specific log-message tests are provided as `undertowStartedLogMessage*`.
- **3 reactive stop/graceful-shutdown tests** (inherited from TCK): `Undertow.stop()` tears down the XNIO worker immediately. The old native `UndertowHttpHandlerAdapter` (removed from Spring Framework 7.0) kept worker threads busy for the request duration; the Servlet bridge dispatches to the servlet engine's async executor instead. Servlet-based graceful shutdown works correctly.
